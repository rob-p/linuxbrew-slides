Reproducible Science
================================================================================

## Reproducible Science

Given the manuscript, someone can...

+ Repeat the experiment
+ Analyse the data
+ Draw the same conclusion

## Repeatable Science

Given the same data and source code, someone can...

+ Repeat the analysis and reproduce the same results
+ Repeatable by yourself, at least
+ Hopefully repeatable by others as well!

## Reproducible vs. Repeatable

Science is built upon reproducible experiments

+ Often we don't even accomplish repeatable science
+ So let's start there

## To Repeat an Analysis

+ Download the data --- requires Open Science
+ Download the tools --- requires Open Source

. . .

+ Install the tools --- requires inexhaustible patience

Linuxbrew Homebrew
================================================================================

## Homebrew

## Linuxbrew

+ Install software packages in your home directory
+ Does not require root access or `sudo`
+ Use the same package manager on your Mac laptop and Linux server
+ Supports any Linux distribution from the last decade
+ Installs packages and their recursive dependencies

## Linuxbrew

+ Up-to-date software, including bioinformatics software
+ Easily install recent versions of `gcc` and `glibc` in your home directory
+ Install precompiled binary packages or from source
+ Maintained by a fervent community of contributors
+ 600 science packages, 250 bioinformatics, 3600 core

## Homebrew Science

## Conclusion

+ Open Science and Open Source are critical components of reproducible science
+ You must be able to install that software
+ Linuxbrew streamlines the installation of software in a repeatable fashion
